How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was quickly able to see the differences
    Easy to read output
    Learned how to use diff

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find typos
    Able to try things out without fear of losing work
    Able to check in working versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros
    ----
    Only save major changes
    All commits could be known good/working versions
    Cons
    ----
    Human in the loop
    Could forget
    Loss of changes on crash

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Related changes only work together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can see the changes
    I can see the comments
    I can get the ids from the git log and use them in git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Always able to go back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything!
